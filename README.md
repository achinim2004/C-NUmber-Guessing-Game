# 🔢 C Language Console: Number Guessing Game

## 💡 Project Overview
This is a classic console-based "Guess the Number" game developed using the C programming language. It is designed to be a simple, interactive project that demonstrates fundamental C concepts like loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1.  **Run the Executable:** Compile the `guess_game.c` file and run the resulting executable file (e.g., `./guess_game`).
2.  **Define the Range:** The game will first ask you to set the minimum (Min) and maximum (Max) limits for the secret number (e.g., 1 to 100).
3.  **Limited Attempts:** You will be given a limited number of attempts (default is 4) to guess the number.
4.  **Follow the Hints:** After each guess, the game will provide a hint:
    * **"⬇️ Too High! Go lower."**
    * **"⬆️ Too Low! Go higher."**
5.  **Win or Lose:**
    * If you guess correctly, you win!
    * If you run out of attempts, the game is over, and the secret number will be revealed.
